# Simple-Login-System

Must create a "database.json" file in the same directory to read/write to. 

This is a simple sign up/login system using the customtkinter library for GUI. Signing up stores a username and password into a file named "database.json" and logging in checks the file for a match. Passwords are encrypted using the hashlib library and using SHA256.
